## Basic Idea
The basic idea of this demo implementation was to get an impression of the following topics, most of them are actually used in the current implementation.

* Genetic Algorithms
* Crossover Algorithm
* Neural Networks
* Noise Generation
* Procedural World Generation
* Vectors and Movement in 2D
* Collision Detection
* Barycentric Technique
* Color Perception

## Next Steps
A rough listing of new features I want to implement in the future.
* implementing a sensor for creatures in view
* display the neural network in the UI
* toggle each sensor (group) in configuration section

## Resources
